# Canadian Archive of Women in STEM and Wikidata

Inspired by [Carnegie Hall Data Lab](https://carnegiehall.github.io/datalab/) and [Yale's Science Stories](http://www.sciencestories.io/welcome), I would like to experiment Wikidata and other technologies such as [IIIF](https://iiif.io/) for the [Canadian Archive of Women in STEM project](https://biblio.uottawa.ca/en/women-in-stem/about).
